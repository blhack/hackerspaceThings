#Inclusivity

A hackerspace gives everyone equal oppurtunity to participate regardless of income, education, or  
religious or political affiliation.  This does not mean that everybody CAN participate, simply that
everybody is welcomed to try.  People who harm the hackerspace's abililty to function will be 
thought to expressed their desire not to participate.
